/**
 * <p>A deterministic key chain is a {@link } that uses the
 * <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki">BIP 32 standard</a>, as implemented by
 * {@link }, to derive all the keys in the keychain from a master seed.
 * This type of wallet is extremely convenient and flexible. Although backing up full wallet files is always a good
 * idea, to recover money only the root seed needs to be preserved and that is a number small enough that it can be
 * written down on paper or, when represented using a BIP 39 {@link },
 * dictated over the phone (possibly even memorized).</p>
 *
 * <p>Deterministic key chains have other advantages: parts of the key tree can be selectively revealed to allow
 * for auditing, and new public keys can be generated without access to the private keys, yielding a highly secure
 * configuration for web servers which can accept payments into a wallet but not spend from them. This does not work
 * quite how you would expect due to a quirk of elliptic curve mathematics and the techniques used to deal with it.
 * A watching wallet is not instantiated using the public part of the master key as you may imagine. Instead, you
 * need to take the account key (first child of the master key) and provide the public part of that to the watching
 * wallet instead. You can do this by calling {@link #getWatchingKey()} and then serializing it with
 * {@link #()}. The resulting "xpub..." string encodes
 * sufficient information about the account key to create a watching chain via
 * {@link #(, String, )}
 * (with null as the first parameter) and then
 * {@link DeterministicKeyChain#()}.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class builds on {@link } and
 * {@link } by adding support for serialization to and from protobufs,
 * and encryption of parts of the key tree. Internally it arranges itself as per the BIP 32 spec, with the seed being
 * used to derive a master key, which is then used to derive an account key, the account key is used to derive two
 * child keys called the <i>internal</i> and <i>external</i> parent keys (for change and handing out addresses respectively)
 * and finally the actual leaf keys that users use hanging off the end. The leaf keys are special in that they don't
 * internally store the private part at all, instead choosing to rederive the private key from the parent when
 * needed for signing. This simplifies the design for encrypted key chains.</p>
 *
 * <p>The key chain manages a <i>lookahead zone</i>. This zone is required because when scanning the chain, you don't
 * know exactly which keys might receive payments. The user may have handed out several addresses and received payments
 * on them, but for latency reasons the block chain is requested from remote peers in bulk, meaning you must
 * "look ahead" when calculating keys to put in the Bloom filter. The default lookahead zone is 100 keys, meaning if
 * the user hands out more than 100 addresses and receives payment on them before the chain is next scanned, some
 * transactions might be missed. 100 is a reasonable choice for consumer wallets running on CPU constrained devices.
 * For industrial wallets that are receiving keys all the time, a higher value is more appropriate. Ideally DKC and the
 * wallet would know how to adjust this value automatically, but that's not implemented at the moment.</p>
 *
 * <p>In fact the real size of the lookahead zone is larger than requested, by default, it's one third larger. This
 * is because the act of deriving new keys means recalculating the Bloom filters and this is an expensive operation.
 * Thus, to ensure we don't have to recalculate on every single new key/address requested or seen we add more buffer
 * space and only extend the lookahead zone when that buffer is exhausted. For example with a lookahead zone of 100
 * keys, you can request 33 keys before more keys will be calculated and the Bloom filter rebuilt and rebroadcast.
 * But even when you are requesting the 33rd key, you will still be looking 100 keys ahead.
 * </p>
